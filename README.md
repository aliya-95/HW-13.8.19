# HW-13.8.19

For an online conference, you need to write a program that will calculate the cost of tickets. The program should work differently:

1. At the beginning, the user is asked for the number of tickets he wants to purchase.

2. Next, for each ticket, the age of the visitor is requested, according to the value of which the cost is selected:

- If the attendee of the conference is under 18 years old, then he/she enters the conference free of charge.
- From 18 to 25 years old - 990 rubles.
- From 25 years - the total cost of 1390 rubles.
3. As a result of the program, the number of cases is displayed. At the same time, if a person registers more than three people at the conference, he additionally receives a 10% discount on the total cost of the order.

To check, upload the resulting solution to GitHub and attach the application.
